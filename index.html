    <h2>How to Stay Cybersecure on the Internet 2025 (Friendly for All Generations)</h2>
    
    <p><strong>1. Use Strong Passwords</strong><br>
    One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect your online accounts is by using strong, unique passwords. Weak passwords are easily cracked by cybercriminals, so ensure that your passwords are long (at least 12 characters), complex (including letters, numbers, and special characters), and unique for each site or service.<br><br>

    A good practice is to use a password manager. This tool can generate and store complex passwords for each site, ensuring you don’t reuse them across different platforms. Avoid using common phrases or easily guessed information like your name, birthday, or pet's name.<br><br>

    In addition, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible. 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (like a text message or app code) after entering your password. Even if someone gets hold of your password, they won’t be able to access your account without the second verification step.

    <p><strong>2. Keep Your Software Updated</strong><br>
    Software updates may seem like a minor task, but they often contain crucial security patches that protect your devices from vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals are always looking for security gaps in operating systems, apps, and browsers. When an update is available, it’s important to apply it as soon as possible.<br><br>

    This applies to both operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and applications (web browsers, antivirus programs, etc.). Many updates fix security flaws that could be exploited by hackers. If you ignore them, you leave your devices open to attack.<br><br>

    Ensure that automatic updates are enabled, so you don’t have to worry about missing important patches. For apps, go into the settings of the app store (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) and enable automatic updates. By keeping everything up-to-date, you're reducing the chances of cyberattacks exploiting known vulnerabilities.

    <p><strong>3. Be Cautious with Email and Links</strong><br>
    Phishing is one of the most common ways cybercriminals gain access to personal information. Phishing emails appear to come from legitimate sources, like your bank or an online retailer, but they often contain malicious links or attachments. Clicking on these links can download malware to your device or steal your login credentials.<br><br>

    To protect yourself, always verify the sender’s email address before clicking on any links or downloading attachments. Be especially wary of emails that contain urgent or alarming language, such as “Your account has been compromised!” or “Immediate action required.”<br><br>

    Additionally, hover over links to inspect their true destination. Even if the text says “Click here,” the actual link may take you to a fake website. Avoid clicking on links in emails from unfamiliar senders, and always type the web address directly into your browser if you need to log in to a site.
